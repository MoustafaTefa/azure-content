# Add authentication to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-users-legacy](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-users-legacy.md)]

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]
4. [Store authentication tokens on the client]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)] 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension.md)] 

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)] 

<ol start="6">
<li>In Visual Studio, open your client app project and ensure that in App.xaml.cs, the instance of **MobileServiceClient** is configured to use the cloud URL to the mobile service.</li> 
<li><p>Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.</p>
   
   	<p>This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the <em>TodoItem</em> table now requires authentication.</p></li>
</ol>

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-authenticate-app](../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-authenticate-app.md)] 

[AZURE.NOTE]When you have registered your Windows Store app package information with Mobile Services, you should call the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=311594" target="_blank">LoginAsync</a> method by supplying a value of <strong>true</strong> for the <em>useSingleSignOn</em> parameter. If you do not do this, your users will continue to be presented with a login prompt every time that the login method is called.

##<a name="tokens"></a>Store the authorization tokens on the client

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-authenticate-app-with-token](../includes/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-authenticate-app-with-token.md)]

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
